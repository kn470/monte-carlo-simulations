# monte-carlo-simulations
A series of Monte Carlo simulations for various scenarios
project ideas taken from : https://pub.towardsai.net/monte-carlo-simulation-an-in-depth-tutorial-with-python-bcf6eb7856c8#6185
but none of the code taken from there

the first is a Monte Carlo simulation of a coin toss. Running the script will give the probability of a heads calculated the Monte Carlo way, and plot a graph of how the calculated average probability improves with each iteration. I realise that this is a very straightforward result, but this was merely to get to grips with the machinery of the Monte Carlo method

the second is a Monte Carlo simulation, attempting to estimate the value of pi. Running the script will give the extracted value after n points generated, and the graph of the extracted value against the number of points generated

the third is a Monte Carlo simulation of the Monty Hall game show problem. Running the script will give the number of wins if you stick and if you switch. It will also give a graph of the the overall probability of winning after a certain number of trials, for both sticking and switching

the fourth is a Monte Carlo simulation of Buffon's Needle problem, which in the end gives an estimate for pi. Running the script will give the final extracted value of pi along with a graph of how the extracted value changed with increasing iterations

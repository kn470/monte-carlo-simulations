# monte-carlo-simulations
A series of Monte Carlo simulations for various scenarios

the first is a Monte Carlo simulation of a coin toss. Running the script will give the probability of a heads calculated the Monte Carlo way, and plot a graph of how the calculated average probability improves with each iteration. I realise that this is a very straightforward result, but this was merely to get to grips with the machinery of the Monte Carlo method

the second is a Monte Carlo simulation, attempting to estimate the value of pi. Running the script will give the extracted value after n points generated, and the graph of the extracted value against the number of points generated
